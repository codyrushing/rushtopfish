          __RushTopFish__ is the natural evolution of a decade long artistic
          partnership between Carissa Topham Fisher and Emily Rushing.


          We love to create artistic work that draws on aspects of contemporary, modern dance techniques as well as abstracted physical theatre. We provide performance opportunities for local artists as well as offering weekly dance training for dance professionals.


          Our work is a raw processing of our experiences as humans on this planet. Through movement we aim to explore and illuminate the full spectrum of what it means to be alive. We believe that dance isn’t only about performance but it’s about connection, and having shared moments of joy, sorrow, laughter and absurdity with our audiences, collaborators and community.

          ## Carissa Topham Fisher


          Carissa Topham Fisher is a rare Austin TX native who has been dancing professionally around town since graduating from college in 2010. She was hired right away by the Kathy Dunn Hamrick dance company who she still performs and collaborates with to this day. During her time with KDH she had the pleasure of performing numerous works by KDH herself as well as collaborating and choreographing in select shows where company members were asked to contribute. She is currently performing KDH work by new artistic director Alyson Dolan, and loving every second of being in the studio. In addition to KDH she has performed work by Darla Johnson, BLiPSWiTCH and has collaborated on a great many pieces with Emily Rushing. Alongside Emily Rushing she has choreographed work that has been seen at Austin Dance Festival, Dance Carousel, Small Plates Dance Festival, Austin Community College as well as producing SMORG a dance show where they created several small duets and invited other local dance makers to show work. Carissa continues to deepen her practice by teaching dance class for Austin dance lovers and professionals (RushTopFish-Kinetic Mashup) as well continues to take weekly class to keep both her body and creative mind fresh. Carissa's movement and teaching style draws on contemporary/release techniques with a focus on athleticism and musicality, and she values being curious and open to the senses in class, rehearsal and performance. She loves getting lost in the creative process and aims to create and perform in a way that leaves audience feeling viscerally connected to the work. In addition to choreographing dance works, Carissa is a painter (under the name CarLeigh Artworks), she creates sound scores for many of the RushTopFish works by layering sounds, textures and music, and is on the KDH costume team and helps design and shop for all KDH Dance costumes alongside Cara Cook.


          Carissa holds a BFA in dance from The University of North Texas, a pilates teacher certification through STOTT Pilates. In addition to her career in dance she is also a dedicated Pilates teacher and mother.
